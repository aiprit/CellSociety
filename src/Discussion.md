Name: Rob Martorano(rfm21) and Susan Lang(sml59)

We created a super class for red and blue block that is a sub class of block but a super class to red and blue block.
This allowed us to pull out multiple methods that are the same for the red and blue block.  We also made some of the methods abtract.
