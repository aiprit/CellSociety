Hi all,
The User_interface basics are in place.  There is a borderpane that is separted into 3 sections:
    top which is title
    right which is a vertical box that has buttons
    left which is a grid pane
        the grid pane is being really weird and the new button will have to be replaced with the rectangles soon
controller class is for buttons.
